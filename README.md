# Testing Workflow template syntax
Testing whether the [`$default-branch` syntax for GitHub Actions workflow templates](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization#creating-a-workflow-template) works in standard workflows.

See https://github.com/github/docs/discussions/5071 for discussion of this question.
